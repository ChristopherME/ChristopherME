### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm a self taught android SWE from PerÃº ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª. I've been making Android apps for multiple sectors such as e-commerce, transport, banks, health, tracking, etc. Since 2016. 
My love-hate relationship with technology took me to discover habilities I didn't knew I had and ever since, 
I've won world-wide contests, and even had the chance to be exported all the way from PerÃº to Germany ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª for work on more Android apps!

On my free times I love to watch movies, listening to music and of course, surf ğŸŒŠ.
